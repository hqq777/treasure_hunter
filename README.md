# Treasure Hunter
Treasure Hunter is an application for users who want to find something they are interested in but don’t know where to buy it. By using this app, users can simply take a photo and the app will let the users know details about the item including the price, the brand, the description and a link of the shopping website. If users are not satisfied with the results we provided, they can modify the feature tags we recognized by the Google Cloud Vision API and search again. If they are still not satisfied with the result, they can share the item photo to other media like Instagram and ask others for help.
Treasure Hunter has several functions, including a built-in camera for taking a photo or retrieving a picture from the gallery, cropping feature to highlight the interests in the image, image recognition, product searching and user’s profile management.
